Use this extension to quickly create endpoints for your forms and save them in a [Google Spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about). This extension will use official [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs) to save your data in the Google Spreadsheet.

### Things you will need:

- Firebase [Cloud Functions](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/functions) and must be enabled in your project's console. The extension will need these to function properly.

- A Google Spreadsheet file. If you don't have one, you can [Create a new one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/create).

#### Billing

To install an extension, your project must be on the [Blaze (pay as you go) plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)

- You will be charged a small amount (typically around $0.01/month) for the Firebase resources required by this extension (even if it is not used).
